QMUL Second Haskell Coursework Exercise

A haskell program to scan the IMDB for the fabled "six degrees of Kevin Bacon"

This is the result of a coursework project in which I was required to write something in Haskell that would scrape web pages, and connect to a database with at least two tables. Not the least vague specification in the world, but also not the the most vague (that goes to the person who wrote "How much do you charge for normal software? I have a normal software project that I would like built")

I know that it's already been done, more than once, but that's by the by... it met the spec for my coursework. 

Features

Safe for work (removes adult films from results)
Multi-core optimized
Capable of scraping from any starting point (not just Kevin Bacon)
Takes a surprisingly long time to run a full scan, even on a high-speed fibre broadband connection

Not supported
(because it would mean that it took even longer to run, and I had a deadline to meet)

TV work
Non-actors
Adult movies
