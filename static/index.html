        <h1>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</h1>
        <p>Popular culture posits that anyone in the IMDB can be linked back to Kevin Bacon through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">no more than six links</a>. Depending on your definitions, that may well be true. In the interests of brevity, though, I needed to reduce the number of pages I was crawling somewhat as I only had about six weeks in which to gather data.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <!-- Example row of columns -->
      <div class="row">
        <p>The haskell project backing this very website at which you are looking is running from a database built up by crawling outwards from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000102/">Kevin Bacon's imdb page</a>, identifying all the feature films in which he has had a credited role (55 at last count), then the aggregated credited cast of those 55 films - 2088 individuals. Those 2088 people have a degree of Kevin Bacon of 1, having worked directly with him. Working outwards, we can identify 15420 further films in which those people have had a credited role, with a total of 250,639 more credited actors who therefore have a bacon number of 2. We continue crawling outwards until no new actors are identified.</p>
        <p>The specific limitations I imposed on my crawling were:
            <ul>
                <li>Only feature films should be considered - no TV, short films, documentaries, etc.</li>
                <li>Adult films should be excluded as they tend to have large casts, who make a lot of films. Eww</li>
                <li>Uncredited roles are not included</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The sample database provided alongside my coursework, though, doesn't necessarily include all of these filters at every stage, as I started crawling pages long before I finished writing the code. Fortunately, you can configure your own crawl, starting with anyone in the IMDB, should you so desire.</p>
        <p>The crawling process took a little over a month on a domestic high-speed fibre broadband connection, during which time around 2,000,000 pages were requested. A repeat run on an equivalent connection would, most likely, take much less time thanks to later optimizations:
            <ul>
                <li>The HTTP requesting code has been optimised somewhat by using ByteStrings</li>
                <li>The crawler has been reconfigured to detect the number of available cores and run on all of them simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In total, four different page types required crawling:
            <ul>
                <li>Actor pages (e.g. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000102/">Kevin Bacon</a>) from which we extract individual filmographies</li>
                <li>Film summary pages (e.g. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099582/">Flatliners</a>) to identify and exclude adult films</li>
                <li>Film full credits pages (e.g. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/fullcredits">Tremors</a>) to identify all credited cast members</li>
                <li>Search results pages (e.g. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=nm&exact=true&q=Kevin%20Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a>) for initializing a new database, or for searching on this web page</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>And so, with no further ado, why not <a href="query.html">query</a> the database?</p>
